      <h2>There are many different martial arts; some styles having different variations that have broken off from the original such as Jujitsu and Brazilian jiu-jitsu. Most take many years possible decades to become a full master of that style.</h2>

      <h2>Some styles of martial arts have been around for thousands of years and some have only been developed within the last century. </h2>

      <h3>The styles vary greatly in their teaching. Some are made for sport while others are strictly for self-defense or combat. Many teach the different philosophies of that sport and others focus more on training. Certain styles are made for use almost entirely with weapons, many teach different weapons skills, and some only teach defense against weapons.  </h3>

      <h3>Most martial arts have their students wear colored belts or obi's to show their skill level, starting with white and ending in black belts.  The color levels and number of belts between white and full master black belt vary from style to style. </h3>

      <h3>Belts are worn for a certain amount of time while learning new skills and techniques to pass a test to earn the next belt level.  The time worn is shorter in the lower belt levels usually around a few months with the higher belt levels being a year or more.</h3>

      <h3>Below is an example of a belt system from the OMR Taekwondo Academy. </h3>

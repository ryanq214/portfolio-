      <p>My name is Ryan Quintana and I am a self-taught Front End Web Developer.  I graduated Texas Tech University with a bachelorâ€™s degree in Sociology but I decided
        to make a career change, and after some consideration I set my sites on the IT field.  I love working with computers and technology in general and I
        have always wanted to learn more about it, then I discovered coding and I was fascinated by it.  I learned more about it and realized that you can do so much
        with coding in so many different areas, so I made it my goal to become a developer.  I love the idea that you can create just about anything with coding, if you have an idea you can make it.</p>

      <p>I have studied on my own around my job for a few months learning coding from various online sources such as treehouse, CodeCademy, and Code Wars.
        After work I study and practice coding for about 3-4 hours a day, and do a JavaScript algorithm challenge. As of now I have learned JavaScript, HTML, CSS, JQuery, and Bootstrap to become a
        Front End Developer.  Now I am continuing to learn everything I can about these languages to really master them and then I am going to continue and
        learn the back end side of web development to become a full stack developer.  After which I am going to learn how to make apps and see what other fields of coding catch my interest.</p>

      <p>I am driven, a fast learner, diligent, adaptable, skilled problem solver and passionate about coding and eager to learn more about it.  I
        get along with everyone I work with and learn from the skills and experiences of the people that have been there longer than me.  I am a very relaxed
        and easy going person, I like a work environment where everyone does their job to the best of their abilities and is ready to help each other out.  My
         main hobbies outside of coding are martial arts, reading, movies, shooting, and video games.</p>

      <p>I am seeking an opportunity as a Front End Developer to start my career in coding.</p>  <p>  If you would like to contact me please refer to my Contacts page. </p>

      <a href="places-poveglia.html">Poveglia Plague Island</a>
      <a href="#">Aokigahara--The Suicide Forest</a>
      <a href="#">Island of the Dolls</a>
         <!-- - Xochimilco, Mexico -->
      <a href="#">Bhangarh Fort</a>
        <!-- //- - >/ Kilais located on the way to Alwar and Jaipur in Rajasthan in India. As per a legend there was a black magic sorcerer who cursed the residents of the palace that they all would die an unnatural death and their spirits will stay there for centuries to haunt the fort / kila forever. This fort would really freak any living mortal. One can seldom find a temporary household in the close periphery of this fort. Let us reveal you one more fact about this place. The village households found here are without roofs as there persists a popular belief and experience that the moment a rooftop is built on a house it collapses. This is said to be the most haunted place in India and amongst world's most haunted places. People are not allowed to spend the night in the fort, for obvious reasons. Believe us it is also said that anybody who has been to this place after dusk never comes back ! -->
      <a href="#">Screaming Tunnel, Niagara Falls - Ontario</a>
<!-- This one is for those brave hearts boasting hard of their fearless spirits. This is located beneath the railway track that connects Niagara falls to Toronto and New York. As per a legend about a century ago there was a farm house located just near the south entrance of this tunnel. One night the farm house caught fire and a young girl doused in flame screaming for help running wild.Nobody knows the story how the farm house caught fire. She ran through the tunnel if in case she could get some help but alas she was burnt completely and collapsed. So from that day onwards whoever tries lighting a match in the tunnel the spirit comes out screaming and haunting the person till dead.  -->
